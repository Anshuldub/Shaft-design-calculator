# Shaft-design-calculator
My academic project focuses on creating an interactive application designed to determine the optimal shaft diameter and visualize it within software. This application will integrate engineering principles with user-friendly interfaces, allowing users to input key parameters such as torque requirements, material properties, and safety factors. Through sophisticated computational algorithms, the application will compute the ideal shaft diameter that strikes a balance between strength and weight considerations.

Additionally, the software will offer dynamic visualizations of the designed shaft, providing users with clear and insightful representations. These visual aids will not only aid in understanding the design process but also facilitate informed decision-making during the shaft design phase. By combining accurate engineering calculations with intuitive visualization capabilities, this project aims to equip engineers and designers with a powerful tool for optimizing shaft designs efficiently and effectively.
